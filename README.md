Hangman's Game is a very famous word game in which the player tries to guess a secret word. The player guesses one letter at a time, and is told where in the word does the letter appear or not appear. Whenever the player guesses a letter that is present in the word, all the occurences of that letter in the word are revealed. With every wrong answered letter, the player is striked to form a figurine of a hanged man. The player wins if the word is guessed currectly or loses if the number of maximum strikes are reached and the hanged man's figurine is made.
This approach is to develop a console based Hangman's game through file handling approach in C++.
